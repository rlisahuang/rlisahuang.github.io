This is a NEW graduate-level research seminar on recent advances in LLMs, programming systems, and HCI. In this course, students discuss research papers and work on final projects on relevant topics. As the teaching assistant, I held weekly office hours for individual and group advising and mentoring and provided feedback on paper presentations, reading responses, and final projects. In addition, I co-led the development of course materials, infrastructure, and syllabus with the instructor.
