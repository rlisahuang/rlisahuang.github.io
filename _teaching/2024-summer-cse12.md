This is the CS2 course for students working towards a degree in many computing-related programs at UCSD. In this course, ~50 students learned about basic data structures, sorting algorithms, and object-oriented design in Java. In this intensive five-week summer offering, every week as the instructor, I led two three-hour lectures, created exams, held office hours, and headed a team of one TA and two tutors. I sought student feedback periodically and adjust the course materials accordingly.
