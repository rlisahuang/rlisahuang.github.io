This is a graduate-level course that exposes students to advanced programming language ideas. In this course, ~200 students learned about lambda calculus, types, parsing, language-programming, etc. in Haskell. Every week as the teaching assistant, I held office hours, graded assignments, and attended staff meetings. At the end of the quarter, I gave synchronous feedback on final project presentations.
