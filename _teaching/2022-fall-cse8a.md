This is the CS1 course for students new to programming. In this course, ~500 students learned about primitives, data types, arithmic, control flow, and data processing in Python. Every week as the teaching assistant, I led 60-minute discussion sections and 60-minute lab sessions, designed lab assignments, held office hours for conceptual questions and lab hours for programming assistance, graded assignments and exams, and attended staff meetings.
