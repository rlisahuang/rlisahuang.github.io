This undergraduate-level elective course is mandatory for participants in the [ERSP program](https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu), mainly second-year undergrauate students and first-year transfer students new to research. In this course, 53 students learned about various kinds of Computer Science research, literature review, experimental and analysis techniques, research ethics, and collaborations. As the instructor of record, I led 90-minute lectures twice a week, held weekly office hours for individual and group advising and mentoring, provided feedback on research proposals and presentations, and oversaw a teaching assistant who facilitated grading and weekly meeting with students.
