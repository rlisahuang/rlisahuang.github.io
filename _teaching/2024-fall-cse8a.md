This is the CS1 course for students new to programming. In this course, ~500 students learned about primitives, data types, arithmic, control flow, and data processing in Python. Every week as the teaching assistant, I led 60-minute discussion sections and 60-minute lab sessions, held office hours, graded exams, attended staff meetings, designed programming assignments, projects, and their autograders and grading rubrics, and led a group of 8 tutors for assignment review and testing.
