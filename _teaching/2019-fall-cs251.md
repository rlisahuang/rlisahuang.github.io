This was a core course for Wellesley College CS majors that exposed students to programming language concepts. In this course, ~40 students learned about lambda calculus, types, parsing, language-programming, etc. in Racket and Standard ML. Every week as the tutor, I held office hours, graded assignments, and attended staff meetings.
