title: "Live Programming in Exploring Synthesized Code"
duration: "2023.1 - Present"
excerpt: "AI-generated code is helpful as building blocks towards a complete program, but understanding the behavior of such code is not easy. What if we utilize live programming to facilitate the comprehension of AI-generated code? We built a prototype incorporating live programming and an AI-powered program synthesizer and evaluated its effects through a user study. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of live programming in assisting code exploration in a variety of ways. "
