title: "Live Programming in Validating AI-Generated Code"
duration: "2023.1 - 2023.9"
excerpt: "AI-generated code is helpful as building blocks towards a complete program, but validating the behavior of such code is not easy. What if we utilize live programming to facilitate the validation of AI-generated code? We built a prototype incorporating live programming and an AI-powered program synthesizer and probed its effects through a user study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of live programming in validating AI-generated in a variety of ways. "
