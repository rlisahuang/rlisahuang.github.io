excerpt: "We used [Projection Boxes](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/pb/), a Live Programming visualization, in an introductory programming class with 600+ students at UCSD over one academic quarter, and found that students preferred Projection Boxes to the baseline IDE and considered them helpful for their learning."
