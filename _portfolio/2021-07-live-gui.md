title: "Live GUI Development"
duration: "2021.8 - Present"
excerpt: "A recent exploration of mine, this work is meant to be a Live Programming environment for writing and debugging event handler code. Imagine you are building a web page that uses JavaScript for event handling. Ideally, as you are editing some event handling JavaScript code on the left, you will see the view of the webpage using this code with automated GUI inputs that lead to the view state as a result of the edit you've just made."
