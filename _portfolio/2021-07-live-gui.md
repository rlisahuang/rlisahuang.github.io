title: "LiveStepper"
duration: "2021.8 - Present"
excerpt: "A recent exploration of mine, LiveStepper is meant to be a Live Programming environment for constructing and debugging event handler code. A GUI event is a transition to a new UI state, while the transition could involve a sequence of visual changes all at once. Debugging these intermediate changes could be hard, let alone the hassle of having to restart and refresh your work on every code change. **LiveStepper** enables working on the JavaScript event handling code on the left while examining the GUI on the right. Ideally, LiveStepper would serve as a **step-wise debugger for GUI event handling**, allowing the user to:

1. Visualize the UI changes without having to provide GUI inputs (*automated GUI testing*);

2. Gain immediate, continuous feedback on every code change (*live programming*);

3. Examine every change on the UI on every line of statement (by moving their cursor around the editor)."
