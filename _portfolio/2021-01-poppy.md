title: "PopPy"
duration: "2021.1 - 2021.3"
excerpt: "I explored the idea of PopPy in collaboration with Kasra Ferdowsi in a class project. Also built on top of [SnipPy](https://snippy.goto.ucsd.edu/), PopPy allows the user to write _partial_ instead of _full_ specifications for program synthesis, which can be especially useful when the specs involve long, complicated data structures."
