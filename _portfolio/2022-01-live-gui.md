title: "Live Programming for GUI Applications"
duration: "2021.12 - 2022.9"
excerpt: "GUI applications often preserve complex behavior building upon at least three layers of information: GUI changes, code execution, and user-interactions. To help programmers reason about the behavior of GUI applications during debugging, I built a live programming environment that directly displays a time line of intermediate GUI states upon user interactions with the GUI. Without using logs or breakpoints, users can see a timeline of changes in the GUI and their connections to the code in the tool, and such information is always up-to-date to the code."
