title: "Step'n'Tune"
duration: "2021.12 - Present"
excerpt: "The fulfillment of live programming results in program outputs that are always up-to-date with the code. In non-terminating systems, such fulfillment could fail when specific contexts are not provided. To address this problem, we proposed a new paradigm called _live programming with output interactions_, which obtains contexts for live programming through user interactions with the program output and provides live feedback on the output given such contexts. We implemented this paradigm in a system for developing GUI applications called **Step’n’Tune**. **Step’n’Tune** allows the user to alternate between coding and interacting with the UI in the same interface, live-visualizes all the execution traces and intermediate UI changes per interaction, and keeps the execution and UI traces up-to-date with the code."
