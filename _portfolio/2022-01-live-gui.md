title: "Debugging in-Flow"
duration: "2021.12 - 2022.9"
excerpt: "Programmers are _in flow_ of debugging when non-debugging distractions are minimized and continuous feedback on the program execution is provided. Existing debugging paradigms interrupt the flow of debugging from two angles: (1) programmers need to figure out the right places to insert logs or breakpoints to reveal the intermediate states of interest, and (2) the debugging needs to be explicitly restarted when the code is changed, with potential modifications to the existing logs and breakpoints. We propose a new debugging paradigm that reduces such interruptions. We implemented this paradigm in a system for developing GUI applications called **Unfold**. Without using logs or breakpoints, users can see a timeline of changes in the GUI and their connections to the code with Unfold, and such information is always up-to-date to the code."
