duration: "2021.8 - Present"
excerpt: "A recent exploration of mine, LiveStepper is meant to be a Live Programming environment for constructing and debugging event handler code. Current efforts involve (1) a preliminary design and implementation of LiveStepper, and (2) a need-finding study to better understand the struggles of event handling and DOM manipulation and to improve the design of LiveStepper."
