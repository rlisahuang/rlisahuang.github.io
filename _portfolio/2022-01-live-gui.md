title: "Step'n'Tune"
duration: "2021.12 - Present"
excerpt: "We proposed a new paradigm called interactive live programming, which provides live feedback both when the programmer modifies the program and when they interact with the program output. We implemented this paradigm in a system called Step’n’Tune in an important context: web-based event driven programming. Step’n’Tune allows the user to alternate between coding and interacting with the webpage in the same interface, live-visualizes all the execution traces and intermediate UI changes per interaction, and keeps the execution and UI traces up-to-date with the code."
