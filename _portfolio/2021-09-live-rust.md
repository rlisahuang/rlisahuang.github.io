title: "Live Rust"
duration: "2021.9 - Present"
excerpt: "Rust is becoming extremely popular for various domains of programming, but its unique features of ownership and lifetimes make the learning curve steep. <b>In collaboration with people in the ProgSys group</b>, we're imagining a Live Programming environment for Rust that visualizes ownership and lifetimes to help programmers build and confirm their mental models for these properties."
