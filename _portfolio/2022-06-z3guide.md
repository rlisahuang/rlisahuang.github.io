title: "Z3 Guide"
duration: "2022.6 - 2022.9"
excerpt: "I developed the Z3 Guide, a 100% client-side web-based educational environment for logic modeling with the Z3 SMT solver. The development of Z3Guide adopted an iterative design with Z3 educators. Since deployment, it has been well perceived by educators and students of logic modeling and Z3. It is also a first step towards reviving rise4fun, a legacy web environment for research tools developed at RiSE @ Microsoft Research. This work was done during my internship in summer 2022 at Microsoft Research. See [my fork](https://rlisahuang.com/z3guide) of the version concluded at the end of my internship, or [here](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide) for the most recent official Z3 Guide."
