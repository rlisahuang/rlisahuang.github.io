title: "Online Z3 Guide"
duration: "2022.6 - 2022.9"
excerpt: "I implemented the Z3 Guide, a 100% client-side web-based programming/learning environment for Z3 during my Internship in summer 2022 at Microsoft Research, working with Ayana Monroe, Dr. Nikolaj Bjorner and Dr. Peli de Halleux. The development of Z3Guide adopted an iterative design, and has been well perceived by educators and learners of Z3. It is also a first step towards reviving rise4fun, a legacy web environment for research tools developed at RiSE @ MSR. See [my fork](https://rlisahuang.com/z3guide) of the version concluded at the end of my internship, or [here](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide) for the most recent official Z3Guide."
