title: "Functional Debugging"
duration: "2022.9 - Present"
excerpt: "Programmers use debuggers for imperative languages to facilitate debugging. How about debuggers for functional languages? Do functional programmers use debuggers? Or even, how do functional programmers debug? We do not have enough evidence to answer these questions. As an initial step, we interviewed four expert Haskell programmers to find out. Our preliminary findings show that while debugging strategies for Haskell are similar to strategies for other languages, some features of Haskell and functional programming introduce challenges to using these debugging strategies. _Our work-in-progress_ aims to gain more understanding of how debugging is done in Haskell and functional programming in general, and to explore design opportunities for usable debugging aids in this domain."
