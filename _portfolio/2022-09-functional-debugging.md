title: "Functional Debugging"
duration: "2022.9 - Present"
excerpt: "Functional programming is a paradigm in which programmers write code using structures such as functions and modules.
Compared to imperative programming, which focuses more on how the runtime state should be updated to perform a computation, functional programming adopts a more declarative syntax that highlights what the computation should achieve without involving mutable states.
Since functional programming fundamentally differs from imperative programming,  programmers might adopt different debugging strategies in functional programming.
However, how programmers debug in functional languages remains under-explored.
We are interviewing expert programmers to gain insights into how they debug in Haskell, a popular functional programming language, as well as observing their debugging sessions.
We hope to identify common debugging strategies and patterns in functional programming, to solicit language- and paradigm-specific challenges in debugging, and to derive a design space of debugging tools for functional programming."
