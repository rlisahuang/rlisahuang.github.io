## (Human) Languages
I _love_ learning languages. 

- As of August 2022, I speak 4 languages fluently: English, Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese.

- My fluency in French is intermediate (but super out of shape), after 1.5 years of intensive study during undergrad. 

- I can also read and write Kana (the Japanese alphabet) and Hangeul (the Korean alphabet), thanks to the years of interest in Japanese and Korean cultures.
