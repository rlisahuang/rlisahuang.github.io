<!-- 
- I have been playing / jamming solo recently due to COVID and not being able to find a chamber group / band to jam with in SD. However, friends in UCSD CSE might resume their pre-COVID jamming sessions very soon, so I really look forward to that!

- During college, I picked up the Baroque flute (traverso), the precurssor of modern flutes in the Baroque era. I have performed in chamber music groups on the Baroque flute, and held my first (and only) personal recital on the Baroque flute in May 2019.

- I've also been playing the modern flute since the 7th grade, when I got invited to join the school orchestra. I later became the orchestra's Principal Flute in the 10th grade, and also won the 1st prize in a regional music competition.

- I took my first piano lesson just after I turned 5, and piano became a major part of my life (until I switched my focus to flute). After stopped playing for almost 8 years, I picked it up again in 2021.

- I love classical music, but I am also a big fan of R&B and rock music. My favorite artist is Hikaru Utada (宇多田ヒカル), and I'm a big fan of the rock band ONE OK ROCK. -->

## (Human) Languages
I _love_ learning languages. 

- As of August 2022, I speak 4 languages fluently: English, Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese.

- My fluency in French is intermediate (but super out of shape), after 1.5 years of intensive study during undergrad. 

- I can also read and write Kana (the Japanese alphabet) and Hangeul (the Korean alphabet), thanks to the years of interest in Japanese and Korean cultures.


## Sports

- Ongoing interests: weight-lifting, hiking
- Also good at: archery
- Attempted but failed: figure skating

<!-- I'm never good at sports, but I've been trying to be better at sports since adulthood (for the sake of health).

- I lift weights and love strength training. Trying to lift heavier day by day.

- I learned Archery in my first year of college and almost joined the competitive Archery Club.

- I attempted to learn ice skating but never succeeded, unfortunately. But I enjoy watching figure skating shows and competitions. I've been a big fan of Yuzuru Hanyu (two-time Olympic gold medalist) since 2018. -->
