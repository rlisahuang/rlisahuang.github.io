## Music
- During college, I picked up the Baroque flute (traverso), the precurssor of modern flutes in the Baroque era. I have performed in chamber music groups on the Baroque flute, and held my first (and only) personal recital on the Baroque flute in May 2019.

- I've also been playing the modern flute since the 7th grade, when I got invited to join the school orchestra. I later became the orchestra's Principal Flute in the 10th grade, and also won the 1st prize in a regional music competition.

- I took my first piano lesson just after I turned 5, and piano became a major part of my life (until I switched my focus to flute). After stopped playing for almost 8 years, I picked it up again in 2021.

- You'd thought I'd only listen to classical music based on my journey. Quite on the contrary, I'm a big fan of R&B and rock music. My favorite artist is Hikaru Utada (宇多田ヒカル), and I'm a big fan of the rock band ONE OK ROCK.

## Languages
I _love_ learning languages. 

- As of May 2022, I speak 4 languages fluently: English, Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese.

- My fluency in French is intermediate, after 1.5 years of intensive study during undergrad. 

- I can also read and write Kana (the Japanese alphabet) and Hangeul (the Korean alphabet), thanks to the years of interest in Japanese and Korean cultures.

- I'm very excited about seriously learning Japanese starting Fall 2022!

## Sports
I'm never good at sports, but I've been trying to be better at sports since adulthood (for the sake of health).

- I lift weights and love strength training. Trying to lift heavier day by day.

- I learned Archery in my first year of college and almost joined the competitive Archery Club.

- I attempted to learn ice skating but never succeeded, unfortunately. But I enjoy watching figure skating shows and competitions. I've been a big fan of Yuzuru Hanyu (two-time Olympic gold medalist) since 2018.
