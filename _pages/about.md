My name is Lisa. I am a PhD Candidate studying Computer Science at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) advised by [Sorin Lerner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). 
I have spent summers at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) researching HCI, programming languages, and education.
Before coming to UCSD, I obtained my B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu) near Boston, MA, 
where I worked extensively with [Franklyn Turbak](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~fturbak/). 

I study programmers of all kinds and build programming systems for them. 
<!-- How do we incorporate more human factors into designing programming systems? How can programming interfaces better support creativity and communication of thoughts? How do we build more _active_ programming assistants that always align with the user's workflow?  -->
How do we incorporate more human factors into designing programming systems?
How should programming interfaces adapt to updates in programming workflows while accounting for domain-specific user needs?

Besides research, I am passionate about [Teaching](/teaching/) Computer Science, from introductory programming to upper-level research seminars. I received the Doctoral Excellence in Teaching Award from the UCSD CSE department in 2024.

Outside of my day job as a computer scientist, I am an amateur figure skater, pianist, and flutist.
