My name is Lisa. I'm excited by programming languages (PL), human-computer interaction (HCI), and cognitive science. 

I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) advised by [Sorin Lerner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). 
Before coming to UCSD, I obtained my B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences from [Wellesley College](https://www.wellesley.edu) near Boston, MA, 
where I worked extensively with [Franklyn Turbak](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~fturbak/) on PL and HCI.

See [Fun](/fun/) for my life outside of computer science.
<!-- where I worked extensively with [Franklyn Turbak](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~fturbak/) on designing a textual representation for the block-based MIT App Inventor. -->

<!-- My academic interests lie in the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction, include programming language design, error reporting and handling, and human-(programming) language interaction. -->
<!-- Through programming tools that are user-friendly and accessible, I aspire to lower the boundaries to learning computer science and programming for everyone. -->

Research
------
I design and develop programming tools. My current research _vision_ is the following: I hope to improve *human <-> human communication*, the main media of which are computers, specifically programming tools. Such communication can be subdivided into two categories, each coming with questions I aim to address:

<!-- 1. **Tool Designer-to-User Communication.** How should the designer of a programming tool (languages, interfaces, etc.) effectively communicate their design intent and the capabilities of the tool to the user, so that the tool is learnable and usable? What needs to be done so that the users' needs are taken into consideration during the design and development of the tool?

2. **Programmer-to-Programmer Communication.** What needs to be done in a programming tool such that it helps a programmer understand code written by the others (including machines)? -->
1. **Self-to-Self Communication.** What programming aids can be developed to help the programmer correctly reason about the program behavior, assiting them with refining their mental model? How can one receive aids in understanding code they wrote a while ago?

2. **Self-to-Other Communication.** How do we help programmers communicate their thought processes more effectively with collaborators, synchronously and asynchronously? What meta-data of cognitive processes can be embedded in programming languages and interfaces?

<!-- old -->

<!-- I build interactive systems for programming, hoping to bring more cognitive ergonomics to programmer <-> computer communication in programming tasks. Note that this is a _two-way_ communication:

1. From the computer's perspective, with the abundance of information available when a program is being authored, modified and executed, I aim to present the most relevant information to the programmer in an appropriate manner using techniques such as **instrumentation** and **slicing**; and

2. From the programmer's perspective, I would like to improve the existing programming setup such as **the design of IDEs** and **input modalities** to ease the processes of code authoring, comprehension, navigation and debugging.-->

<!-- I aim to build programming tools that are **learnable, intuitive, and practical**.
- By _learnable_, I mean with a flat learning curve for everyone from beginners to experts.
- By _intuitive_, I mean cognitive ergonomic, matching tool usage with human cognition such that "what you mean is what you will get" (WYMIWYG).
- And, by _practical_, I mean scalable to real-world programming that often involves large-scale codebases and data. -->

To that end, I adopt the **human-centered** approach to design programming environments: 
- I use evidence from cognitive science and empirical investigations to derive the design space of a programming tool; and
- I work with potential users of a programming tool to refine the design space and to iterate on existing designs.

<!-- I believe that under different _contexts_ of programming (e.g., debugging vs. authoring, functional vs. imperative), programmers adapt their programming strategies to the corresponding contexts.  -->
I believe that **comprehension** is key to the successful execution of many programming tasks (e.g., debugging, refactoring), and my goal is to develop programming tools that help programmers understand the information presented to them in order to be more effective with other programming tasks.
<!-- My research concerns **cognitive ergonomics in programming systems**, and my goal is to develop context-specific programming tools that suit well with programmer strategies. -->
<!-- I incorporate potential users of my work early in the design process through **need-finding** and **participatory design**.  -->

<!-- To that end,  -->
<!-- I build **live programming**-based tools for various domains of programming, and  -->
<!-- I use **mixed methods** to understand programmers as well as to improve the design of programming environments. My life-long mission is to make programming a more enjoyable experience.  -->

<!-- , but I'm always open to adopt other programming techniques to build programming tools that make programming a more enjoyable experience. -->
