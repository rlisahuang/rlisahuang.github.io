I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, affiliated with the [ProgSys Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) and advised by [Sorin Lerner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). 
My academic interests lie in the intersection of programming languages and human-computer interaction, include programming language design, error reporting and handling, and human-(programming) language interaction.
Through programming tools that are user-friendly and accessible, I aspire to lower the boundaries to learning computer science and programming for everyone.

Previously, I obtained my B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences from Wellesley College (Wellesley, MA, USA). 

Outside of computer science, I enjoy music, cooking, hiking, and reading. As my experience with linguistics suggests, my passion for languages extends beyond programming languages: my first language is Mandarin, my French is B1/B2, and my Japanese is terrible but in progress.
