I am an incoming first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, affiliated with the [ProgSys Group](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/). My academic interests include programming language design, error reporting and handling, and human-(programming) language interaction.

I have obtained my B.A. in Computer Science and Cognitive & Linguistic Sciences from Wellesley College (Wellesley, MA, USA). Previously, I did my undergraduate thesis with [Prof. Franklyn Turbak](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~fturbak) and worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the Wellesley College [HCI Lab](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~hcilab/).

Outside of computer science, I enjoy hiking, reading, cooking, and playing/composing music. As my experience with linguistics suggests, my passion for languages extends beyond programming languages: my first language is Mandarin, my French is B1/B2, my Japanese is terrible but in progress.
